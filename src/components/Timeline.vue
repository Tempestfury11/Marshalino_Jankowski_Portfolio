                                    During my immersive journey at LifeChoices Coding Academy, I delved into the intricacies
                                    of web development, solidifying my passion for crafting digital experiences. Achieving a
                                    full-stack web development certification, I not only excelled academically but also
                                    thrived in hands-on experiences, particularly shining with a 99% pass in the MySQL
                                    module. LifeChoices became more than an academyâ€”it became the forge where my coding
                                    skills were honed and where I discovered the thrill of transforming lines of code into
                                    dynamic, user-friendly websites.
